Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of Big O

03. You have a name, and you want to find the person’s phone number in the phone book.

      O(log n)

        because you can use binary search for this

04. You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s name in the phone book.
    (Hint: You’ll have to search through the whole book!)

      O(n)

        you will need to check every person and check their names and phone

05. You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book.

      O(n)

        you will need to read every item in the list

06. You want to read the numbers of just the As.
    (This is a tricky one!
    It involves concepts that are covered more in chapter 4.
    Read the answer—you may be surprised!)
