01. Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names
    and you’re searching through it using binary search
    What’s the maximum number of steps it would take?

      128 -> 64 -> 32 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

      7 steps

      also you can do log2 (128) that would return 7

        that is the max steps you can do for 128 names


02. Suppose you double the size of the list.
    What’s the maximum number of steps now?

      256 -> 128 -> 64 -> 32 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

      8 steps

      also
        log2 (256) = 8 steps


conclusion
  for any ordered array of N elements
    the max steps to find a value using binary search is
      log2 (N)
